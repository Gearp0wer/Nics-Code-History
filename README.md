Hello.

I'm Nic, and this is my personal github repository.
I'll be using this repository to showcase my work and projects as I prepare for my career in Computer Science (When I'm not pursuing passion projects).

I graduated from the George Mason University Computer Science program in May 2025, and I am excited to share my journey and contributions here. In the meantime, this repository is going to look a bit rough as I condense and re-organize 4 years of work into a single repository.
