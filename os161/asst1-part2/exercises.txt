1. Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored)
convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the language of
synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this
method suboptimal?

Mutual exclusion prevents other drivers from entering the intersection while the current driver is inside it.
If a driver is currently in an intersection, the other routes are considered BLOCKED. Cars attempting to enter the intersection fail and instead are forced to wait their turn in a queue.
Once a car leaves the intersection, it signals the queue to let the next oldest driver into the intersection.

This is suboptimal in cases where a car [A] is attempting to turn into the counterclockwise route, but can't because a car [B] is using a different section of the intersection.
Even if A's route is clear and traversable, A must still wait for B to finish.
This forces cars that otherwise would be able to utilize the intersection to instead clog the queue.
This is also non preemptive, meaning that any car in the intersection *stays* in the intersection until it finishes.
This system on its own also ignores priority. For example, ambulances would be forced to join the queue alongside every other car.




2. Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention
described above. In what one instance can this three-way-stop intersection produce a deadlock?
(It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize
an actual intersection).

If three cars join the intersection and all intend to make a left hand turn, deadlock occurs as each car will be blocking the other.
 No car can proceed because another car is preventing them, but no car is able to be pulled out of the intersection or otherwise removed in order to solve the deadlock.
