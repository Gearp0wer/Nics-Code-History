Look, I'm going to be honest. I have not done much besides contemplate at a high level what the project will require.
I know, it's bad of me to have no code aleady down, but this material has not come easily to me.
I figured it would be better to have a solid grasp of what I was doing/expected to do before I actually did it.
So, its been a lot of me rewatching lectures and trying to find supplementary material online.
I also have no partner for this project. 
Yeah I know it isnt advised, but I really dont have a lot of time and I've been burned one too many times on group assignments.
