I have begun working on the design documents regarding the project. Writing this and thinking about how it's all going to work has been stretching my brain out immensely. However, I am making great progress especially compared to where I was last time. I learned from the previous attempt not to screw around, and I have learned a lot regarding the overall setup. I have done all my studying already, and I am prepared over the next two weeks to crush the project.
