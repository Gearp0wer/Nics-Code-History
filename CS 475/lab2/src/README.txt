Listen I am going to be honest. I put this off, thinking it would be easier than lab 1, and then got swamped with other classes and my job. Not an excuse, just laying out my week. I'm turning this in for whatever points it'll earn despite basically nothing being done. 

Yes I know that we are warned to not take this class and a bunch of others, But I just want to graduate and refuse to wait another year to walk for my degree. 

Hopefully there's at least 1 or 2 more labs that I can recoup some of these lost points on..

thanks,
