HELLO!

I am much more pleased with this section and it isn't even late this time!

To compile:

do as normal! There should be very little you have to do in order to make it work, I just advise you pipe the output to a file.
I'm not sure where in the project notes it specifies the various debug modes, but I have a vague recollection of setting it. I just can't find the dang setting anymore.
So, pipe output to an out file. It will make this not nauseating to watch. Or, because you probably know, turn off the debug mode :(


Thanks for everything!
