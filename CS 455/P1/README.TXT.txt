To compile this, all you should do is run MAKE CLEAN or MAKE ALL while in this directory. This does require you to have installed Winsock and all the other tools necessary to compile and run C on a windows device (gcc and such).

PS: quit does not work. You will have to re run the program each time. If it was a bigger issue to me, I would have fixed it. Bigger priorities though.
