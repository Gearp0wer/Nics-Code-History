The questions on this sheet should be answered as you progress through
Lab 4. They are given in the original order of the main Lab 4 document.
Use the original documentation for Lab 4, but write the answers to the
questions on this sheet. You will submit a soft copy of this sheet as
part of your lab submission. Therefore, you may wish to copy and paste
this answer sheet to an ASCII text editor, write your answers directly
into the editor, and then save the file. NOTE: Do not use any non-ASCII
file formats (like Word or ODS format).

It is important that you follow this narrative carefully, and avoid any
shortcuts in this lab. The answers to many of the questions you will be
given depend upon properly completing the lab in the sequence presented.

Note: This lab must be completed on zeus using the gcc compiler.
Compilers on other systems (mason.gmu.edu, your personal linux machine,
Microsoft Visual C++ or XCode) may not give the same results. The TA
will be looking for specific answers for the grading of this lab and the
use of other compilers may result in incorrect answers.

Step #0:

Step #1:

How many errors appear? 3
How many warnings appear? 2


Step #2:

Step #3:

Run the program, and at the prompt, enter the value 10.
What happens? entering only produces newlines and does not advance the code(also a segmentation fault if you wait long enough)

What value is printed after “The sum of integers 0 to 10 is: “ ? 10
What value *should* have been printed? 55
How many warnings appear without the -Wall option? 0
How many warnings appear with the -Wall option?  2 warnings, 1 note


Step #4:

How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 1
List in order the numerical values of /sum/ output by the printf
statement you added: 10


Answer the following questions again, based on the most recent code
execution:

            How many times does the printf statement you added get
executed? 1

List in order the numerical values of /sum/ output by
the printf statement you added:
10
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement?
10


Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input). Did the "statement
with no effect" warning message go away? yes

Now answer the following questions:

          How many times does the printf statement you added get
executed? 1

List in order the numerical values of /sum/ output by
the printf statement you added:
10
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement?
10


Comment out the for loop, and copy it to the line below, this time
without the semicolon.
Compile and run the program again (using 10 as input). Now answer the
questions:

How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 10
List in order the numerical values of /sum/ output by
the printf statement you added:
0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45

What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement?
45
Is the final value of sum correct? (Look at your answer to step #3
above) no


You are supposed to add the integers from 0 to 10. Which integer is
missing? 10

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input):
Answer the following questions:

How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 10
List in order the numerical values of /sum/ output by
the printf statement you added:
1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55

What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement?
55


Step #5:
Recompile, and run the code. Has the output changed? no

Step #6: If you haven't already, create an electronic version of this
page. You can either keep it as html, or copy it to a text file. Fill
out the answer sheet with the responses you recorded as you went through
the lab. Then submit this document using Blackboard.
